# Allow reaction tests to potentially fail the first time because
# tests sometimes fail due to a SIGKILL during Meteor package npm install.
# Since the install doesn't need to happen on second run, the error is
# often avoided and the false positive doesn't fail the CircleCI build.
#
# This will update npm deps which takes a while
